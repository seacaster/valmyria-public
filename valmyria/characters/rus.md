# Magic Items

## Digby's Hand

**Description**

This gauntlet is an automated, adaptable weapon made up of diamond-shaped metal
scales, and can change its form and damage type to fit the user's needs.

Any infusion on this gauntlet also applies to its other forms.

**Usage** (requires attunement)

The gauntlet has 5 charges and recovers 1d4 charges after a long rest.

You can expend 3 charges to emit a 15 foot cone of force as a bonus action. All
enemies within the cone must make a DEX saving throw against your spell save DC
or fall prone.

As a weapon, the gauntlet has a 1d8 damage die in melee form and a 1d6 damage
die in ranged form. Switching between these forms requires the user's bonus
action.

The wearer can change the damage type of the weapon to a different physical
damage type as an object interaction. The damage type persists until the wearer
uses another object interaction to change the shape of the item again.

The ranged form of the gauntlet counts as a crossbow for the purposes of
interaction with the Crossbow Expert feat.

Attuning to this gauntlet grants the user one additional infusion slot.
