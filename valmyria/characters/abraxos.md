# Magic Items

## Sasha's Scatterbrained Spell-Storer

**Description**

This ring once belonged to Sasha, an infamously forgetful sorcerer who used it
to ensure that he would always be able to cast his favorite spells, whether he
remembered how to invoke them or not. According to legend, he lost this ring in
a duel when he forgot its Command Word.

**Usage** (requires attunement)

The ring has 5 charges, and recovers 1d4 charges at the end of a long rest.

You can speak the ring's Command Word (with the same casting time as the
original spell) to cast its held spell without using a spell slot. The spell's
level is determined by the number of charges consumed:

| Level     |  1  |  2  |  3  |
| --------- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| # Charges |  2  |  3  |  5  |

At the end of a long rest, you can change the spell held in this item, or remove
the currently held spell.

The ring can hold one spell at a time, and the chosen spell is not on your spell
list as long as it remains in the item.

This item does not remove the Concentration requirement from its held spell.
