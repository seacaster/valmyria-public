# Magic Items

## Sauce Pouch

**Description**

This pouch contains a swirling mix of sauce and anti-sauce - some of the
tastiest and nastiest concoctions devised throughout the years by chefs from all
walks of life.

**Usage** (requires attunement)

This magic item resets to 1 charge at the end of a long rest. It can gain
additional charges by casting spells:

- After using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. On a success, the
  pouch gains an additional charge.
  - The success probability is 5% per spell level, so a level 3 spell has a 15%
    chance of creating an additional charge.

Any object dipped in the pouch then touched to a creature will release the
sauce/anti-sauce's effect on said creature. Roll 1d20 to determine the potency
of the effect.

## Token from the Fae

**Description**

A small wooden token that fits in the palm of your hand. One side has ornate
engravings of the forest where you met the Fae. The other side is engraved with
six blank almond-shaped eyes.
