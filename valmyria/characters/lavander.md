# Magic Items

## Huntress' Bangle

**Description**

This magic item once belonged to a legendary ranger-turned-assassin from a
faraway land. It strengthens the bond between a ranger and their companion,
allowing them to take down targets in perfect synchrony.

**Usage**

This item has 5 charges, and recovers 1d4 charges after a long rest.

While equipped, you know the spells Hunter's Mark and Enhanced Hunter's Mark.
These do not count against your number of spells known.

- Casting Enhanced Hunter's Mark consumes a number of charges from this item
  equal to the level at which it was cast, in addition to a spell slot. So
  casting EHM at 2nd level consumes a 2nd-level spell slot and 2 charges.
- When your companion hits an enemy you can see, you can use your reaction to
  cast Enhanced Hunter's Mark on that enemy.
- If the marked target drops to 0 HP before the spell ends, you can use your
  reaction or your companion's movement to mark a new creature. (If you use your
  companion's movement, your companion's movement is 0 on its next turn.)

### Enhanced Hunter's Mark

This has the same casting time, range, and duration as Hunter's Mark, but has
the following additional benefits:

- Enhanced Hunter's Mark does not require concentration
- The additional damage scales with spell level - 1d6 at 1st level, 2d4 at 2nd
  level, and an additional 1d4 for each spell level above 2nd.
- When your companion hits an enemy you can see, you can use your reaction to
  cast Enhanced Hunter's Mark on that enemy.
- If the marked target drops to 0 HP before the spell ends, you can use your
  reaction or your companion's movement to mark a new creature. (If you use your
  companion's movement, your companion's movement is 0 on its next turn.)
